+ Project summary: In this project, we work together to explore two algorithms in the field of machine learning fairness: one algorithm is Information Theoretic Measures for Fairness-aware Feature selection and another is Handling Conditional Discrimination (LM and LPS) [which refers to A4 and A6 in Piazza]. Based on the data, COMPAS with binary class label(y) and binary sensitive attribute (race), we evaluated accuracy and calibration.
